        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Carter Bryant, and I will be graduating this 
          semester with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Regarding CS, 
          my interests lie within software engineering and web development, 
          which I plan to pursue as a career, though I am also looking into IT 
          opportunities.

          Concerning my interests, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, 
          listening to music (Japanese rock being my favorite genre), and 
          learning Japanese in my spare time. At some point, Iâ€™d also love to 
          get back into playing the clarinet, which I played back in high school
          but couldn't continue due to time constraints, or even try out the 
          flute.

        <h1>Spaced Repetition Systems</h1>
        <p>Often times when it comes to learning a new language, it can be difficult
          to learn and memorize a large number of vocabulary words, especially so 
          for languages such as Chinese and Japanese which contain thousands of 
          unique characters. One method that can aid one's journey is by using a
          concept known as <strong><i>spaced repetition systems</i></strong>, or <strong>SRS</strong>
          for short. To describe spaced repetition systems, we first must introduce 
          the idea of <strong>spaced repetition</strong>, which is a learning 
          technique in which one extends or shortens the interval between studying 
          material - vocabulary for example - depending on if they correctly answer 
          said material or not. Applying this concept to an SRS, this type of system
          will appropriately sort the vocabulary you've reviewed into categories based
          on whether you answered correctly and how much time has passed between
          review sessions. For example, an interval for studying a vocabulary word 
          may start out at 10 minutes, and if you correctly memorize and 
          recite the word's meaning after that interval is over, you can extend that
          time to 30 minutes. Alternatively if you got it wrong, you can try reducing
          the time to 5 minutes instead. Here's a link to a separate article that 
          goes over the concept in more detail:
